## Description

_This program will capture values based on topping and size selections in using css animated checkboxes. Based on what the user chooses, the price will fluctuate and be displayed on the page. Based on the specs below, the price returned may differ. The program will use an object constructor, as well as prototype methods to perform behaviors that will give the user a cost for the pizza and the size they picked. An image will also appear upon submitting their order._
