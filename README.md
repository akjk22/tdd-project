# _Super Galactice Age Calculator Independent Project_

#### _This project will display knowledge of test driven development following a red, green, refactor workflow. 03/5/2020_

#### By _**Andrew Kim**_

## Description

_This program will show knowledge of ES6 concepts, test driven development using Jest, npm, and Webpack. It will also show business logic to test a users age on different planets, years left to live based on predetermined life expectancies, and the years surpassed life expectancy._

## Specs

* _The program shows working tests for age on different planets, years left to live based on predetermined life expectancies, and the years surpassed life expectancy based on an earth age that's inputted._

### Jupiter
* _Age_
  * _input_: "20" (earth age)
  * _output_: "1" (planet age)

* _Years left to live_
  * _input_: "20"
  * _output_: "4"

* _Years surpassed life expectancy_
  * _input_: "100"
  * _output_: "3"

 ### Mars
* _Age_
  * _input_: "20" (earth age)
  * _output_: "10" (planet age)

* _Years left to live_
  * _input_: "20"
  * _output_: "40"

* _Years surpassed life expectancy_
  * _input_: "100"
  * _output_: "3"

### Mercury
* _Age_
  * _input_: "20" (earth age)
  * _output_: "83" (planet age)

* _Years left to live_
  * _input_: "20"
